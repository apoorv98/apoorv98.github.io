<p> This is the list of LATEX commands which might be helpful. The list includes commands I used during my graduate course. The list was created for my reference so I don't have to keep searching somewhere else in case I forgot one or some of these.</a></p>
<p> To begin these are not very difficult to get hang of once you start using it regularly for writing assignments, notes, references, resumes, etc. I also have some templates [here](https://github.com/apoorv98/latex-templates) so check them out, and search the internet if this list is not sufficient. I will also link some useful websites down below for reference. </p>

## Commonly used packages
It's true you can add functionality to LATEX by adding packages like additional fonts, specific math commands, additional text edition features. You need to import them before begining the document. Some of the ones I use on a regular basis are:
* \usepackage{times}
* \usepackage{fancyhdr}
* \usepackage{textcomp}
* \usepackage{titling}
* \usepackage{hyperref}
* \usepackage{amsmath}

## Commonly used commands
* ```
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  		\end{tablular}
    \end{center}
  ```

## Math specific commands
* \mathbf - Bold face text in math mode



## Useful links:
* [WikiBooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) - Original resource, might scare at first because of the book in the title. Don't worry it's easy to follow. But check the following links for quick reference when you are stuck. There are also other guides around, but this covers all in detail.
* [ShareLATEX](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn) - Very helpful especially for beginners.
* [http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/) - Community or forum based site, lots of people with experience to answer your questions or make you better in LATEX in general.
* [Cheat sheet](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/) - I wouldn't recommend this, but hey having a cheatsheet around is not a bad idea.
