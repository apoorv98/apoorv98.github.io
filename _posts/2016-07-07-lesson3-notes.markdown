Continuing with Convolutional Neural Networks, we explore more concepts and dwell into some techniques to improve our model.

Follow the links below to jump between sections in this post:

1. [CNN in detail](#cnn-in-detail)
2. [Underfitting and Overfitting](#underfitting-and-overfitting)
3. [Reducing overfitting and maximizing accuracy of model](#reducing-overfitting-and-maximizing-accuracy-of-model)

### CNN in detail

In [last lesson](), we discussed the importance of visualizations and also saw an example depicting the layers of CNN. In this lesson, we explore another tool called [Deep Visualization Toolbox](). This is very handy, since you can input your own image and observe each layer of CNN model for what it has learned.

### Note add image here


Such visualization tools help us better understand the workings of CNN.
