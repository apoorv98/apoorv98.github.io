# Key Contributions
1. Game Logic Implementation: Implemented the core game logic, including player turns, win condition detection, and tie detection, adhering to the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

2. User Interface Development: Designed a simple command-line interface (CLI) for the game, providing clear instructions and prompts for players to make their moves.

3. Input Validation: Implemented input validation mechanisms to ensure that players' moves are within the valid range of the game board and prevent invalid inputs from causing errors.

4. Game Modes: Expanded the game to include different modes, such as player vs. player, player vs. AI, and AI vs. AI, offering players a variety of gameplay options.

5. AI Implementation: Integrated an AI opponent using algorithms such as Minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to provide challenging gameplay for single-player mode.

6. Testing and Debugging: Conducted thorough testing and debugging to identify and fix issues related to game logic, user interface, and AI behavior, ensuring a smooth and error-free gaming experience.

7. Documentation: Created comprehensive documentation covering the project's architecture, implementation details, and instructions for running and playing the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

# Project Outcomes
* Successfully developed a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game application with multiple gameplay modes and an AI opponent.
* Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, algorithm implementation, and software design principles.
* Received positive feedback from peers and mentors for the clarity of code, completeness of features, and overall quality of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation.
