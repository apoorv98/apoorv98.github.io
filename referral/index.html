    <p>I have this card for more than two years and I like it a lot. Points earned in this card are Chase Ulitimate Rewards Points. They are super valuable since you can redeem them for air travel for 20% off when booked from Chase webistes (normally the same price you found on other sites). You can also transfer to participating frequent travel programs like United MileagePlus, Hyatt Gold Passport, etc. For example, you can transfer the points 1:1 ratio to Hyatt points, which you can use to book Hyatt hotels and the points are values at least 1.5 cents/point. Essentially, the 55,000 points you get from openning the card are valued at least $825 if you consider booking hotel using Hyatt or $687.5 if you booking travel through Chase. $0 Introductory Annual Fee the first year, then $95 after the first year.
