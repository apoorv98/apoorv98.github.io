  <h4>Ascent Descent Localization</h4>
  <p>The goal of the project is to find the most appropriate feature detector at various levels in underwater to use for localization. To achieve the goal a robot collects footage both while ascending and descending and this data is then used on several commonly used feature detectors and descriptors to find the best match.</p>

  <h4>Experimental Comparison of Open Source Vision-Based State Estimation Algorithms</h4>
  <p>The problem of state estimation using primarily visual data has received a lot of attention in the last decade. Several open source packages have appeared addressing the problem, each supported by impressive demonstrations. Applying any of these packages on a new dataset however, has been proven extremely challenging. Suboptimal performance, loss of localization, and challenges in customization have not produced a clear winner. Several other research groups have presented superb performance without releasing the code, sometimes materializing as commercial products. In this paper, ten of the most promising open source packages are evaluated, by cross validating them on the datasets provided for each package and by testing them on eight different datasets collected over the years in our laboratory. Indoor and outdoor, terrestrial and flying vehicles, in addition to underwater robots, cameras, and buoys were used to collect data. An analysis on the motions required for the different approaches and an evaluation of their performance is presented.</p>

  <h4>The Aquarium cloning workflows</h4>
  <p><a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> is a smart laboratory operating system invented in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> where researchers can specify how to manipulate items that stored in the inventory using protocols and workflows written in computer codes. Adapted from the standard molecular cloning workflows, I wrote a majority of the codes in Ruby implementing two core molecular cloning workflows: plasmid construction and yeast cloning. These workflows take and batch users' inputs to the workflow and semi-automatically schedule the entire cloning process from ordering primers to Sanger sequencing verifications, resulting a nearly effortless cloning process in Aquarium. This technology also led to the startup <a href="http://www.aquarium.bio/" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> where I work as an engineer to build out the 21st century laboratory operating system, enabling reproducible and transferable workflows in biology labs and more.<p>

  <h4>Frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast</h4>
  <p>I developed an experimental process in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> to interrogate frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast. The approach was using a microfluidic device called <a href="http://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/life-science-research/cell-culture-systems/cellASIC-live-cell-analysis/microfluidic-plates/68eb.qB.wfkAAAFBWmVb3.sJ,nav" target="_blank">CellASIC</a> to grow the yeast cell, where one can control the system precisely with different frequencies of auxin inputs and observe using fluorescence microscopy over time. I wrote Matlab based software to do image processing on the time course fluorescence images, which resulted in quantified time-course fluorescence data on the cells. Using the data, I generated a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot" target="_blank">Bode plot</a> describing the frequency response of signaling pathway. The result showed that this pathway works as a low-pass filter.</p>
