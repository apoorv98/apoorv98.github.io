  <h4>A novel switchable bistable switch in yeast</h4>
  <p>The genetic bistable switch is a fundamental building block for engineering synthetic living systems. In synthetic biology, researchers have designed and constructed rudimentary bistable switches in <i>E. coli</i> and in mammalian cells. However, it remains challenging to construct a reusable, modular, switchable bistable switch in eukaryotes. In this project, I designed and built a novel switchable bistable switch in yeast, the model organism for eukaryotes. This switch can be switched on and off by adding two kinds of small molecules.</p>

  <h4>A plant hormone induced oscillator in yeast</h4>
  <p>Biochemical oscillators are fundamental to understanding cell physiology, and present an ongoing challenge in building synthetic living systems. In synthetic biology, researchers have built a number of oscillators over the last decade resulting in various designs in organisms from E. coli to mammalian cells. However, especially in eukaryotic cells, a robust, tunable, and modular oscillator technology has yet to be demonstrated. In this project, I designed and analyzed a plant hormone induced oscillator in yeast. I developed mathematical model and showed that the oscillator could be achieved by tuning two key parameters. Currently I am working on experimental realizing this oscillator.</p>

  <h4>The Aquarium cloning workflows</h4>
  <p><a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> is a smart laboratory operating system invented in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> where researchers can specify how to manipulate items that stored in the inventory using protocols and workflows written in computer codes. Adapted from the standard molecular cloning workflows, I wrote a majority of the codes in Ruby implementing two core molecular cloning workflows: plasmid construction and yeast cloning. These workflows take and batch users' inputs to the workflow and semi-automatically schedule the entire cloning process from ordering primers to Sanger sequencing verifications, resulting a nearly effortless cloning process in Aquarium. This technology also led to the startup <a href="http://www.aquarium.bio/" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> where I work as an engineer to build out the 21st century laboratory operating system, enabling reproducible and transferable workflows in biology labs and more.<p>

  <h4>Frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast</h4>
  <p>I developed an experimental process in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> to interrogate frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast. The approach was using a microfluidic device called <a href="http://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/life-science-research/cell-culture-systems/cellASIC-live-cell-analysis/microfluidic-plates/68eb.qB.wfkAAAFBWmVb3.sJ,nav" target="_blank">CellASIC</a> to grow the yeast cell, where one can control the system precisely with different frequencies of auxin inputs and observe using fluorescence microscopy over time. I wrote Matlab based software to do image processing on the time course fluorescence images, which resulted in quantified time-course fluorescence data on the cells. Using the data, I generated a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot" target="_blank">Bode plot</a> describing the frequency response of signaling pathway. The result showed that this pathway works as a low-pass filter.</p>
